# Hi, I'm Kolt

I design and build software. Not one or the other — both.

Principal Software Consultant based in NYC. I either build products solo end-to-end, or architect solutions and lead engineering teams through delivery.

**Recent work:** [Kolt's Table](https://koltstable.com) — a seasonal cooking platform I designed and built solo in six months.
- 180KB production bundle (53% smaller than NYT Cooking)
- Sub-50ms recipe search via PostgreSQL GIN indexes
- 96/100 Lighthouse performance score
- 60+ normalized PostgreSQL tables, zero technical debt
